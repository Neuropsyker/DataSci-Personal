    "Precision is a measure of the accuracy of the positive predictions made by a model. It answers the question: \"Of all the instances predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\" Precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.\n",

    "Recall measures the ability of a model to capture all the relevant instances. It answers the question: \"Of all the actual positive instances, how many were correctly predicted as positive?\" Recall is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.\n",

    "Classification models are a type of supervised learning algorithm that predicts the class or category to which a data point belongs. Here are some examples of classification models:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Logistic Regression:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm used for binary and multiclass classification problems. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decision Trees:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees split the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each node. They are widely used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Random Forest:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions. It often improves accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Support Vector Machines (SVM):*\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is a powerful algorithm for both binary and multiclass classification. It finds a hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "*k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):*\n",
    "\n",
    "k-NN classifies data points based on the majority class among their k nearest neighbors in the feature space. It is a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Naive Bayes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' theorem and makes assumptions about the independence of features. It is particularly useful for text classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Neural Networks:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models, particularly neural networks, are powerful classifiers that can automatically learn hierarchical representations from data. They are used for various tasks, including image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gradient Boosting Algorithms:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost and XGBoost, build a series of weak learners sequentially, with each one focusing on the mistakes of the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):*\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a classification and dimensionality reduction technique. It finds the linear combination of features that best separates multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA):*\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to LDA, QDA is a classification algorithm that makes fewer assumptions about the variance-covariance structure of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ensemble Methods:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods, like bagging and stacking, combine multiple models to achieve better predictive performance than individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gaussian Processes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian processes are probabilistic models that can be used for classification tasks. They model the distribution over functions and provide uncertainty estimates."
