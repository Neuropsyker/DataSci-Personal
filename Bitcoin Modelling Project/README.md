## Bitcoin project 

Summary: The aim of this project is to understand bitcoin price and bitcoin price fluctuation. We have assessed a number of different variables and this document is there to help you recreate this piece of analysis. 

For clarity, this was a group project I participated in during my training. This is not solely my work as it includes inputs from others.
